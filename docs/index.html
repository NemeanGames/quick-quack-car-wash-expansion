      <h2>About This Project</h2>
      <p>
        The expansion of Quick Quack Car Wash into new markets requires
        understanding the competitive landscape, forecasting future growth and
        evaluating membership profitability. The datasets provided include
        competitor counts by state, growth trends for major car‑wash brands,
        membership revenues, forecasted store openings and a small sample of
        customer reviews. By combining geospatial, time‑series and sentiment
        analyses, we can paint a picture of opportunities and risks for future
        expansion.
